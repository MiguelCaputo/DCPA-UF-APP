## Description: 

The name for our project is DCPA UF App which is an acronym that simply describes the name of the organization and our university. Our plan is to build a mobile application for the Design, Construction, and Planning Ambassadors (DCPA). This is an organization that has a goal of generating interest and attracting new students to the College of Design, Construction, and Planning. This app will consist of multiple features that will aid both members of the DCPA and students who plan on joining the DCP college in the future. For the former, this app will give the Ambassadors a way of being better organized, by using features such as a calendar, which they can use to schedule meetings and events, have a clear-cut schedule of tours, and more. The app will also give the Ambassadors the ability to describe the organization and include present news. For prospective students, they will be able to schedule tours through the email feature within the app, and in the case that the student is not able to attend an in-person tour, the app will also offer a virtual tour option. This will be done through a link where the students will be able to schedule a virtual tour through Zoom with the ambassadors, which will encompass the in-person tour. Other features that the app will include are a map that will show the location of the user, that way they are able to find their way around campus, as well as a feature that will have general information about UF and Gainesville for newcomers.

## Software System:
We will build a mobile application using the React Native framework. React Native utilizes the programming language JavaScript and HTML to allow us to create mobile applications for both Android and iPhone mobile devices. We are planning to utilize Javascript to implement our backend, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and lastly, we are planning to use MySQL to build the database. We would most likely utilize the google calendar, map, and email APIs in order to make the app more dynamic and easy to use for our users. The mobile applications would later be tested in the Expo framework which provides a set of tools and services built around React Native that would allow us to try and deploy the application on real devices. 

## Project Management Tool:
For our project management tool, we will use Trello. Trello will allow us to stay organized as a team by creating tasks and checklists with color-coded labels that will make it easy for the team to follow along and see the progress of the project. We will also be able to assign team members to different parts of the project at a time, that way everyone knows which tasks to work on. Finally, this project management tool will also allow us to set clear objectives each week, as well as, explicit deadlines to stay on schedule.
